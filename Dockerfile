# Runner container image
# Kali Rolling + crucible-runner binary + actions.sh library
# Built separately from the main Crucible images (uses Kali, not Alpine)

# Kali base image, overridable to pin a digest:
#   docker build --build-arg KALI_BASE=kalilinux/kali-rolling@sha256:<digest> ...
#
# This ARG MUST stay above the first FROM. An ARG declared after a FROM belongs
# to that build stage, so `FROM ${KALI_BASE}` for stage 2 would expand to an
# empty string and fail with "base name (${KALI_BASE}) should not be blank".
ARG KALI_BASE=kalilinux/kali-rolling

# --- Stage 1: Build the Go binary ---
FROM golang:1.25-alpine AS builder

RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates

WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# --- Stage 2: Kali Linux runtime ---
#
# WHY KALI: Assessment workflows execute offensive-security checks against student
# VMs (port scans, SMB enumeration, credential spraying, web fingerprinting, etc.).
# Ubuntu 24.04 does not ship the required tooling in its default repos. Kali Rolling
# does, with versions maintained by Offensive Security and kept current via rolling
# releases.
#
# WHY THE TOOL LIST IS CURATED: kali-linux-large and kali-linux-everything are
# multi-GB meta-packages that push the image well over 3 GB and exceed the runner
# Job's cold-pull deadline on a fresh node. Only tools actually invoked by current
# assessment workflows are included here.
#
# SIZE TARGET: Keep the final image under 3 GB. Do NOT add kali-linux-large,
# kali-linux-everything, or metasploit-framework -- each adds several GB.
#
# COLD PULL NOTE: kali-rolling is not pre-pulled on runner nodes. The first pull
# after a new digest can take 1-2 minutes on a cold node. Plan maintenance windows
# around image refreshes; consider a pre-pull DaemonSet if cold-start latency
# becomes a problem against Job deadlines.
#
# KALI_BASE is declared globally at the top of this file -- see the note there.
FROM ${KALI_BASE} AS runtime

# Avoid interactive prompts during package installation
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# The tool inventory is NOT written out here. It is derived from
# runnertools/tools.txt, which is the single source of truth shared
# with the Go script validator.
#
# It used to be spelled out twice in this file — once as an apt list and once
# as a `command -v` loop — plus a third, implicit copy in the heads of whoever
# wrote the workflows. Those three could drift independently, and the drift was
# silent in the worst direction: a tool present in the apt list but absent from
# the verification loop would ship missing, and a tool absent from both could
# still be called by a saved workflow and fail as a bare exit 127 during a
# graded assessment.
#
# Packages are a HARD requirement. kali-rolling package names do drift, and an
# earlier draft of this file swallowed install failures with a "WARNING: SKIPPED"
# echo so a rename could not break the build. That is the wrong trade: a runner
# image that builds green but silently lacks netexec/hydra does not fail loudly —
# it produces wrong assessment results for students. A broken build is visible and
# takes minutes to fix; a toolless runner is invisible and corrupts grades.
# If CI fails here after a kali-rolling update, fix the package name in
# tools.txt. Do not reintroduce a best-effort loop.

# Strip file capabilities from every binary in the image.
#
# Kali's nmap package ships /usr/lib/nmap/nmap with
#   cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw=eip
# so that unprivileged users can run SYN scans. Inside this container that
# permitted set is NOT a subset of the process bounding set — CAP_NET_ADMIN
# (bit 12) is absent from a default containerd bounding set — and execve()
# refuses any file whose permitted caps exceed the bounding set. The result is
# that EVERY nmap invocation fails with "Operation not permitted", including
# unprivileged `-sT` connect scans that need no capability whatsoever.
#
# Removing the file caps is the right fix rather than granting NET_ADMIN to the
# Job: the runner already executes as root with CAP_NET_RAW effective, so raw
# sockets and SYN scans still work, and widening a Kali container's privileges
# on a student VLAN to solve a problem that requires no privilege would be a
# straightforwardly bad trade.
#
# The assertion is static (`getcap -r /` finds nothing) rather than a runtime
# `nmap` smoke test, because buildkit runs with a wider capability set than the
# deployed container — a runtime test here would pass while production stayed
# broken, which is exactly how this defect survived in the first place.
